## Purpose

This is a sample application for a workshop I did at Devnexus 2022. 
It returns a list of Kong products and Devnexus sessions.

## Authentication

The API is intended to be public with no authentication credentials required. 
Security will be implemented via Kong Gateway's rate limiting functionality.
